This project is really a complete and utter disappointment. I am so sorry.

If I had to guess at what went wrong, firstly I started super late in the game. Secondly, I could not just pick something and go with it. At first I wanted to do something with boids, but I could not figure out how to get parcel, since it looked like I also needed npm, and for that I needed something else (I think nvm?), so I moved on. Surely there was another simulation that might be easier. I spent a short time trying to understand fluid simulations before decideing to just try makings multiple modifications to physarum. I tried making the simulation change to music, but while I could get music to play, as soon as I started messing around with AudioContexts it stopped working completely. Then I tried having the agents change direction based on the gyroscope on a phone, and I thought I had gotten it to work, but for whatever reason the direction does not change on my phone. This is what I ended up with, and I ultimately just added some tweakpane sliders to change the falling direction.

This all could have easily been avoided if I had just asked for help, but either through stubbornness to get things working on my own or through embarrassment of asking such rudimentary questions so late in the game, I ended up staying silent.

It is now very very late, and I am very very tired. I can only hope that submitting *something* instead of nothing will be enough to help me squeeze by with a C. 

I am very sorry.
